This section started with the introduction of thing I learnt in this section i.e. "Primitive Data Types".
      Primitive data type:
          Data types that have some values, or a specific memory is allocated for them are primitive data types.
          i.e. byte 
               int
               short
               long
               float
               double
               decimal etc.
      
Difference between Variables and Constants:
  Variables:
      Vari-ables mean changeable data types are variables.
  Constants:
      Non-changeable data types are constants.

Type Conersion
3 types of conversions:
    Implicit Conversion:
          i.e. Conversion of 1 byte to 1 Int32
    Explicit Conversion:
          i.e. Conversion of 1 Int32 back to 1 byte, for this we need to declare the data type and this is known as "Casting".
    Non-Compatible Conversion:
          i.e. Conversion of Primitive data types with non-Primitive data types.
          i.e. string s= "1234" to int = 1234.
          for this I learnt a C# function Convert.ToInt32.
          
Operatorss:
    Arithimaticals Operators: 
          +
          -
          /
          *
          %
          
    Assignment Operators:
          +=
          -=
          *=
          /=
          
    Logical Operators:
          && (AND)
          || (OR)
    Bitwise Operators:
          & (AND)
          | (OR)
          ! (NOT)
    Comparison Operators:
          < (Less than)
          > (Greater than)
          = (Equal to)
          != (NOT Equal)
          <= (Less than equal to)
          >= (Greater than equal to)
